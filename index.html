      Obiloch do be on the lock
      He's got term clean scheduled, no cap.
      President Daniel will be working on the doc.
      He ain't gonna to need a tap.
      
      Miller do be working on the fighting combo.
      Micah won't be able to match.
      John always feels like a dumbo.
      When are we going to the branch.
      
      Obiloch be hangin in the streets.
      Daniel be holdin him back.
      Can't believe we can't be laying down those beats. 
      Definitely won't be putting those on a tack.
      
      This poems got rhyme
      but its a darn near crime.
